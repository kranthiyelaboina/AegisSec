Summary of Changes Made to Fix API and Automation Issues
========================================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Completely removed hardcoded API keys to prevent OpenRouter from marking them as exposed
- Fixed automation engine crashing with "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'chat'" error
- Fixed missing 'target' parameter in analyze_tool_output() calls
- Created secure API key management without dependency checking
- Made API key input visible during configuration

CHANGES MADE:

1. REMOVED HARDCODED API KEYS:
   - Deleted src/hardcoded_config.py (contained exposed API key)
   - Removed all references to hardcoded_config from:
     * main.py
     * src/deepseek_client.py  
     * setup_wizard.py
     * test_hardcoded_config.py (deleted)

2. FIXED DEEPSEEK CLIENT NULL CHECKS:
   - Added client availability checks in fix_command_error()
   - Added client availability checks in _test_api_key()
   - Methods now return fallback responses when API client is None

3. FIXED AUTOMATION ENGINE PARAMETER ERRORS:
   - Fixed analyze_tool_output() calls missing 'target' parameter in:
     * run_tools() method
     * _process_tool_output() method  
     * run_intelligent_automation() method
   - Added target extraction in run_tools() method

4. CREATED SECURE SETTINGS MANAGEMENT:
   - Created src/settings_manager.py - comprehensive settings UI
   - Created configure_settings.py - standalone settings script
   - Modified CLI to use new settings manager
   - NO DEPENDENCY CHECKING during API key configuration
   - API key input is VISIBLE (not hidden with password=True)

5. UPDATED CONFIG VALIDATION:
   - Modified ConfigManager to work with SecureConfig
   - Fixed validate_config() to use secure storage instead of config files

USAGE:
------
Configure API Key (without dependency checking):
    python configure_settings.py

Or from within the application:
    python main.py
    -> Select option 5 (Settings)

The API key will be:
- Stored securely and encrypted locally
- Visible during input (not hidden)
- Configured without any dependency checking
- Safe from git exposure

TESTING:
--------
All automation now works properly:
- With API key: Full AI-powered automation
- Without API key: Fallback mode with basic functionality
- No more "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'chat'" errors
- No more "missing 1 required positional argument: 'target'" errors

The system is now secure, functional, and ready for production use.
